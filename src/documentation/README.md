1. Project Overview:
The Perfuma project is a luxury e-commerce platform built using Next.js, Sanity CMS, and third-party API integrations. The platform is designed to offer an intuitive, seamless shopping experience for users, with an emphasis on easy product management, efficient checkout, and smooth admin functionality. Key integrations include payment gateways (Stripe, EasyPaisa), shipment tracking (Shippo, ShipEngine), and authentication through NextAuth.js.

2. Key Features:
User Registration & Authentication: Secure login and session management, including third-party login options (Google, Facebook).
Product Management: Products can be listed and categorized through Sanity CMS, with all CRUD operations supported.
Shopping Cart & Checkout: Users can add, remove, and update products in their cart and proceed to a secure checkout process.
Order Management: Users can track their orders, view their order history, and receive updates on shipment status.
Admin Features: Admins can manage products, users, and orders from a dedicated backend dashboard.
3. Technical Specifications:
Frontend: Developed using Next.js 14, with TailwindCSS for responsive styling. React Context or Redux is used for state management.
Backend: Built with Next.js API Routes, MongoDB for data storage, and Sanity CMS for managing product content.
Integrations: Integrated payment processing (Stripe/EasyPaisa), shipment tracking (Shippo/ShipEngine), and user authentication (NextAuth.js).
4. Day-by-Day Breakdown:
Day 1: Project Setup and Foundation
Set up the project with Next.js, MongoDB, and Sanity CMS as core components.
Focused on architecture and preparing for frontend and backend development.
Day 2: Frontend Development
Created static pages for essential functionality like product listing, login, and registration.
Used TailwindCSS to ensure responsive design across devices.
Day 3: Backend Integration
Built API routes for user registration, product management, and order handling.
Integrated MongoDB for persistent data storage and NextAuth.js for user authentication.
Day 4: Dynamic Frontend Components
Implemented dynamic routing for product detail pages.
Created reusable components for the product listing, cart, pagination, and search functionality.
Improved UI/UX with category filters and responsive layouts.
Day 5: Testing & Refinement
Conducted extensive testing using tools like Cypress, ZAP, and Lighthouse.
Validated performance, accessibility, and security.
Handled issues related to cross-browser compatibility and UI consistency.
Day 6: Deployment & Staging
Deployed the platform to Vercel, ensuring smooth integration and functionality post-deployment.
Conducted tests on both the frontend and backend, confirming all features (cart, wishlist, checkout, etc.) were working fine.
Set up an admin panel for managing products, users, and orders, and included CSV file generation for data management.
5. Challenges Encountered:
Optimizing Data Rendering: Pagination was implemented to efficiently manage large datasets and improve performance.
Routing & Data Flow: Used dynamic routing and centralized data management to ensure seamless navigation.
Responsive Design: TailwindCSS was utilized to ensure that the platform is fully responsive and works across all devices.
6. Testing and Results:
Functional Testing:
Verified key marketplace features such as the product listing, product detail pages, wishlist, cart functionality, and checkout process. All features were functioning correctly.
Performance Testing:
Desktop Performance (Lighthouse): Achieved excellent load times and performance scores.
Mobile Performance: The mobile version performed well, though slightly behind the desktop version. Accessibility scored 92%.
Security Testing:
Ensured secure communication via HTTPS.
Conducted a vulnerability scan using ZAP, identifying and addressing medium and low-severity issues.
Properly secured sensitive API keys by deleting exposed files and ensuring they are included in .gitignore.
Cross-Browser Testing:
Manual testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox) showed consistent functionality.
BrowserStack testing revealed a minor UI issue with the wishlist icon on smaller screens.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
The application was thoroughly tested by end-users, and feedback was positive with only minor UI issues noted.
7. Final Thoughts:
Perfuma is a modern, responsive e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless experience for both users and administrators. With successful integration of frontend and backend components, the platform's key features have been thoroughly tested and are functional. Minor UI improvements and optimizations will be addressed in future iterations, and the project is well-positioned for further development and release.
